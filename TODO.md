# TODO

## Algorithm Improvements
- [x] Genetic algorithm variant
- [ ] Bottom-left-fill heuristic for initial placement
- [ ] Hybrid GA+SA approach (use SA to refine GA solutions)
- [ ] Multi-start optimization from different seeds
- [ ] Adaptive cooling schedule based on improvement rate

## Performance
- [x] Parallel evaluation of multiple solutions
- [ ] SIMD optimizations for collision detection
- [ ] GPU acceleration for large problem instances
- [ ] Better spatial data structures for overlap detection

## Features
- [ ] **Animation generation of optimization process** (high priority - would be amazing to see!)
- [ ] Export solutions to JSON/SVG formats
- [ ] Convergence plot generation using existing data
- [ ] Different container shapes (circles, rectangles)
- [ ] Non-uniform square sizes (different sized squares)
- [ ] Interactive web interface

## Research Extensions
- [ ] 3D cube packing variant
- [ ] Rectangle packing (different aspect ratios)
- [ ] Circle packing in squares
- [ ] Optimal square packing database/lookup
